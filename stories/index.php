        <h1>Success Stories</h1>
        <p>As I prepared to write <em>The Shangri-La Diet</em>, I gathered success stories from my friends. After the <em>Freakonomics</em> column about the diet, however, my collection of stories was swamped by a much larger number of success stories posted on the Web. This page provides a sampling. In the <a href="http://boards.sethroberts.net">forums</a> over 100 people are posting their <a href="http://boards.sethroberts.net/index.php?PHPSESSID=cbbc4a82d3aa646123ee19ecdb2c7c60&amp;board=5.0">progress</a>.</p>

        <h2>Ann &amp; Co.</h2>
        <p>After Ann Hendricks started her <a href="http://shangrilawatcher.blogspot.com/">blog</a>, about a dozen people regularly reported their progress. Almost all were successful - so much so that Ann asked people to post failures. She didn't get many.</p>

        <h2>CalorieLab</h2>
        <p>After CalorieLab posted a long <a href="http://calorielab.com/news/2005/09/21/seth-roberts-shangri-la-diet-in-detail/">article</a> about the diet, comments poured in, many contradicting the article's skeptical tone with their own experience of success.</p>

        <h2>Michael</h2>
        <p>
          <img src="/images/michael_before.jpg" alt="Michael, before the diet" width="190" height="260"/>
          <img src="/images/michael_after.jpg" alt="Michael, after the diet" width="190" height="260"/>
        </p>
        <p>When Michael was forty-eight, he weighed 254 pounds. He is six feet tall. He had been heavy since grade school. Quite apart from health issues - his knees hurt, for example - his weight was a problem because it caused people to treat him poorly. . . . <a href="/stories/2006-04-30_Michael.pdf">continues</a> <em>&#x2014; Michael, undisclosed location </em> </p>

        <h2>Lily M.</h2>
        <p>&#x201C;I started the Shangri-La diet the same day I read the Freakonomics column about it in the New York Times Magazine.  I swallowed a spoonful of canola oil, and my appetite disappeared almost immediately. . . .&#x201D; <a href="/stories/2006-05-06_Lily.pdf">continues</a> <em>&#x2014;  Lily M., Los Angeles, California </em></p>

        <h2>Sarah</h2>
        <p>Sarah's problem with her weight began when she was young. "When I was nine, I weighed 109," she said. Growing up, she always weighed more than she wanted to.  In her forties, she tried Weight Watchers, which worked for a while. . . . <a href="/stories/2006-04-30_Sarah.pdf">continues</a> <em>&#x2014; Sarah, Bay Area, California</em></p>

        <h2>Sean</h2>
        <p>&#x201C;I started at 184 lbs (I'm 6 foot 1 inch) and, using Seth Roberts's "Shangri-La" approach, lost 11% of my body weight (20.5 lbs or about 1.4 lbs per week) over 15 weeks . . .&#x201D; <a href="/stories/2006-04-30_Sean.pdf">continues</a> <em>&#x2014; Sean, Highland Ranch, Colorado</em></p>

        <h2>Stephen G.</h2>
        <p>When Stephen started the Shangri-La Diet, he weighed 203 pounds.  His body mass index (BMI) was 29, which is considered overweight. The diet was worth a try, he thought. . . . <a href="/stories/2006-04-30_StephenG.pdf">continues</a> <em>&#x2014; Stephen G., Bay Area, California</em>  </p>

        <h2>Stephen M.</h2>

        <p>&#x201C;In 1992 my world fell apart. My eldest child became sick. In the next five years I would bury three children and gain almost sixty pounds. By the time the world was stable under my feet again, I was about 240 pounds and unable to lose weight . . .&#x201D; <a href="/stories/2006-04-30_StephenM.pdf">continues</a> - <em>Stephen Marsh, a lawyer in Texas, who blogs at <a href="http://ethesis.blogspot.com/">http://ethesis.blogspot.com/</a></em></p>
